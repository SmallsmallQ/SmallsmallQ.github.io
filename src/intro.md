## A small article

In the surging waves, I ride a small boat and ripple. Through the small porthole, the distant mountains meet the sunset, and the houses are swaying by the flowing water. In the roar, swaying, swaying, entering the next dream of the bright moon and clouds.

Day after day, life always moves along a fixed track, heading towards the distance where the end is invisible. After staying in one place for a long time, there is a definite answer about tomorrow. Although the life is comfortable and stable, the idea of ​​going out is like a weak electric current, which stirs your heart from time to time. "Go travel!" The voice in your heart calls, so you temporarily put aside the trivial matters at hand, look through the map or guide, or make a long list, or directly pack your bags and head towards the familiar unexplored place.

…

Life is also like a grand and long journey. Come to the world and experience the flavor of three autumns. Being swept up, following the torrent of the times, following the perfect life template step by step, chasing the image in the minds of others, just like chasing guides, rushing to check in at various attractions, coming in a hurry and leaving in a hurry. Heidegger said "Live towards death". At the end of the journey, looking back at the past, regret is inevitable for giving up what you want in your heart because of choosing the standards and mainstream advocated by others. It is better to follow your sincere heart, enjoy the scenery along the way, meet interesting people, and embark on this journey without regrets.
