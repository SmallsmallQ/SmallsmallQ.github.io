## Motto

It's better to follow your heart, appreciate the scenery along the way, meet interesting people, and embark on this journey without regrets.

## Personal Writing

Amid rolling clouds, drifting on a small boat, gently swaying. Through the tiny porthole, distant mountains meet the dusk, houses nestle by flowing waters. In the rumbling sound, rocking, swaying, entering the next dream where the bright moon meets the clouds.

Day after day, life proceeds along its fixed track, heading towards an unseen destination. Staying in one place for long enough, tomorrow's answers become certain. Though living in comfort and stability, the thought of venturing out tingles like a subtle current, occasionally tickling your heart. "Let's go traveling!" calls the voice within, and so you temporarily set aside daily matters, browse maps or guides, make long lists, or simply pack your bags and head towards familiar yet unexplored territories.
